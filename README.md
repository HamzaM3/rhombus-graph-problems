# Rhombus game solutions

This repo contains the algorithm solving the Rhombus game found in this [website](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kekgames.rhomb&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1)

The solution is basically a topological sort but there are 3 modifications that makes the problem more fun.

1. Parity/Coloring of the graph
2. Grouping of nodes
3. Disjonctive edges

(I'll explain these later, just understand it's super fun !)
